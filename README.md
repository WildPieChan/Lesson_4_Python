# Lesson 4

## Introduction to Python (seminars)
### Homework:

<br/>
1. Calculate a number with a given accuracy in "d". $10^{-1} ≤ d ≤ 10^{-10}$
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
- for d = 0.001, π = 3.141. <br/>   
<br/>
2. Set the natural number N. Write a program that will make a list of prime factors of the number N.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Set the sequence of numbers. Write a program that will output a list of non-repeating elements of the original sequence.
<br/>
<br/>
4. A natural degree k is given. Generate a random list of coefficients (values from 0 to 100) of the polynomial and write a polynomial of degree "k" to a file.
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
- k=2 &#8594; 2*x² + 4*x + 5 = 0 or x² + 5 = 0 or 10*x² = 0 <br/>
<br/>
5. Two files are given, each of which contains a record of the polynomial. The task is to form a file containing the sum of polynomials.
